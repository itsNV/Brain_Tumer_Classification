# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify brain MRI images into **four distinct tumor categories**. The model is trained on a large, labeled medical imaging dataset and is designed to assist in accurate and automated tumor detection.

#### 📦 Dataset & Model Availability
Due to size limitations on GitHub, the **dataset and trained model files are hosted on Kaggle** instead of this repository.
